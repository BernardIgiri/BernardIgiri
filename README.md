# Bernard Igiri
I am a full-stack software engineer with over two decades of software development experience. I develop a wide array of software, from high-performance web apps and geospatial tools, to secure platforms and developer-friendly frameworks, to games, libraries, and embedded systems. My work spans Rust, systems programming, web development, cloud infrastructure, and cross-language interoperability. For more about me see:
